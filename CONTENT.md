## The Opportunity

### The Platform Shift
- Massive platform shift — companies know they need AI but don't know how to use it effectively
- Companies are "AI curious" but often chasing trends or copying others without understanding their own problems

### Why Mid-Sized Companies?
Mid-sized companies — especially PE-backed or pre-investment — are under pressure to show bold innovation and operational excellence. AI is the opportunity, but most can't move beyond scattered pilots and buzzword-driven decks.

### Core Thesis
AI isn't just for experts who understand transformers and fine-tuning. **Every person will have to be an expert in *using* AI.** Active use of the tech changes how you think about business and problems. Just like every modern CEO considers the internet automatically in all decisions today, AI will be the same.

### The Cost of Inaction

Restrictive IT policies and underinvestment in AI competency aren't "playing it safe" — they're falling behind permanently. The gap between AI-enabled teams and everyone else is widening every week, and it's not closing.

Even Andrej Karpathy — one of the founders of OpenAI and former head of AI at Tesla — describes the shift as a "magnitude 9 earthquake":

> "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer... I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue."
> — Andrej Karpathy

If one of the world's leading AI researchers feels behind, imagine what's happening inside companies where AI tools are locked down, blocked, or ignored.

**The uncomfortable truth:** Every month your team spends without real AI fluency, your competitors are compounding their advantage. This isn't a technology you can "wait and see" on. The companies that invest in their people's AI competency now will be the ones setting the pace — everyone else will be reacting.

Locking down AI tools doesn't protect your company. It guarantees you'll be hiring to catch up while your competitors are shipping with smaller, faster, AI-augmented teams.

### AI Maturity Model

**Interactive element:** Quiz or AI chat that helps prospects identify their stage and where to start.

#### Phase 1: Foundation — AI Fluency
- Get your team familiar with AI and using the basic tools available to everyone
- ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot — the "everyone should be using these" tier
- Use cases: Speeding up existing processes (customer service, content drafting, research, data entry)
- These are the **obvious wins** — taking what you already do and making it faster

#### Phase 2: Integration — AI-Enable Your Stack
- Configure the tools you already own to use their AI capabilities
- Salesforce Einstein, HubSpot AI, Microsoft 365 Copilot, etc.
- Start leveraging your existing data within familiar platforms
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** bridges Phase 2→3: off-the-shelf tools + your proprietary knowledge

#### Phase 3: Custom — AI Built on Your Data
- Build custom tools on AI models trained on your specific data
- Proprietary knowledge becomes competitive advantage
- Use cases shift from "speed up existing processes" to **things that were never possible before**
- This is where the real moat gets built

**Key insight:** As maturity increases, use cases evolve:
- **Early:** Automating/accelerating existing workflows (obvious, low risk)
- **Advanced:** Entirely new capabilities that weren't feasible before (transformative, high value)

## Why the Name KFoundry

The "K" stands for **Knowledge**. KFoundry is the foundry where client knowledge — use cases, people, data — the raw materials for AI enablement — gets shaped into AI solutions that become competitive advantages.

**Core thesis:** Midsize companies benefit the most from this AI wave because:
- They have **proprietary data and knowledge** that creates real competitive advantage
- They have the **agility and urgency** to actually adopt new ways of working
- (Unlike enterprises that move slow, or startups that lack the data)

**The foundry metaphor:** Just like metals and labor flow into a physical foundry to be shaped into something valuable, KFoundry takes a client's raw inputs and forges them into AI solutions.

## What We Do

### Simple Explanation
- AI services firm based in LA, working with mid-sized and PE-backed companies
- Helping companies adopt AI through consulting and implementation
- Not an "AI product company" — a **problem-solving company** that builds custom solutions or guides to the right ones

### The Approach
Collaboration with your team and upskilling your people — not outsourcing all expertise. Build software and utilize AI within existing tools, but in a way that leaves you **empowered rather than beholden**.

Key differentiator: KFoundry works *with* you, not *for* you. You gain capability, not dependency.

## Thought Leadership: Pragmatic AI Expert (PAIE) Framework

Chase's original framework. Core idea: Every leader needs to become a **Pragmatic AI Expert** — not understanding models or technical details, but becoming fluent in *using* AI tools.

**The hook:** Your team is more afraid of AI than they'll admit — and maybe you are too.

**PAIE ≠ technical expert.** Not training models or understanding transformers. It's knowing how to APPLY AI — in your work, your decisions, your leadership.

**From Chase's CTO talk:** The conversations *after* were the most interesting. That's where the concerns came out — engineers skeptical of AI, leaders unsure how to guide their teams. Fair. The shift is weird, fast, and messy. But this is the job. Our teams need us to be hands-on — try the tools, see what works, lead from experience, not just opinion.

### The Three Stages of Becoming a PAIE

**🚶 Stage 1 — Deliberate Use**
- You're asking: "Could AI help here?"
- Bouncing ideas off ChatGPT or Claude — even just to get unstuck
- Start small. Build the habit by forcing yourself to try AI first.

**🏃 Stage 2 — Default Use**
- AI becomes your first instinct
- You reach for it like Slack or Google
- Drafting board comms, planning projects, exploring ideas — it's just how you work now

**🧑‍🚀 Stage 3 — Disruptive Use**
- Now you're thinking *in* AI
- Reimagining workflows, solving problems others don't know are solvable
- Creative. Strategic. And honestly, pretty fun.

### Three Reasons to Be a PAIE (Talk Framework)

**1. For Your Team**
- Engineers worried about replacement/job security
- Some fear stigma of using AI (appearing lazy or less skilled)
- You using AI normalizes it — sets clear expectations
- Shows it's about quality improvement, not just productivity
- Helps ensure your team isn't left behind in their careers

**2. Navigate the "Jagged Frontier" (Ethan Mollick)**
- Adjacent use cases can have drastically different AI results
- Only way to understand the frontier is to navigate it yourself
- The frontier moves fast (capabilities added constantly)
- A network of AI users across your company gives better coverage
- You can't keep up alone — collective knowledge helps

**3. Power of Compounding Experience**
- Early adopters gain disproportionate advantage
- Non-linear, exponential skill growth
- Working with AI as a "teammate" requires practice — like onboarding a new engineer
- Starting late means falling further behind as the gap compounds

**Demo references (for talks, needs updating):**
- WARP + Ollama (ease of entry)
- Windsurf frontier game + EDQ
- ChatGPT Imagegen vs Gemini workspace
- Gamma

### PAIE Content — Blog Post / LinkedIn Material

**Post: "AI told me to talk less"**

Fed a meeting transcript to AI. It told me to talk less. Not what I wanted to hear — but exactly what I needed. That's Deliberate Use.

**Why leaders need hands-on experience:**
- AI is inconsistent — brilliant at some things, terrible at others
- You can't guide your team through that unpredictability unless you've felt it yourself
- If you've never seen AI nail a hard task and fail a simple one, you're missing what your team is dealing with. And they'll know.

**Practical ways to stretch your use (easy → advanced):**
1. 🎤 **Ask AI for meeting feedback** — feed a transcript in, ask "How did I show up?"
2. 📊 **Set up a project** — use ChatGPT/Claude Projects with recurring context, treat it like a teammate
3. 🤖 **Build your first agent** — low-code tools like Langflow or n8n. Even if you don't finish, you learn a lot.

*"You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be curious — and consistent."*

**Note:** This is evolving — more to come from the field.

### MBA Course: "AI in Practice"

Chase is developing a course for MBA students: **AI in Practice: Strategy, Judgment, and Change in Real Organizations**

- Teaches practical judgment for using AI inside real organizations
- Students become "Pragmatic AI Experts" — hands-on intuition about where AI works and fails
- Focus: strategy, change management, organizational impact (not tools)
- Case studies, mapping the "jagged frontier" of AI performance, guiding teams through uncertainty
- Goal: practical credibility, not technical mastery

**Site angle:** This positions Chase/KFoundry as educators, not just consultants. "We teach this at the MBA level" is a powerful trust signal.

**Connection to maturity model:** The PAIE stages mirror the company maturity phases — individual fluency (PAIE) drives organizational capability (maturity model). They reinforce each other.
